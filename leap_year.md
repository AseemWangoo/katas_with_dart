Problem:
Create a function isLeapYear(year: number): boolean that checks if a given year is a leap year.

Requirements:
Leap year is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400.

Use TDD to implement the solution.
Test Cases:
isLeapYear(2020) ➡️ Expected Output: true
isLeapYear(2100) ➡️ Expected Output: false
isLeapYear(2000) ➡️ Expected Output: true
