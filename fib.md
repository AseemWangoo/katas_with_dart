Question 4: Fibonacci Sequence
Problem:
Create a function generateFibonacci(n: number): number[] that generates the first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.

Requirements:
Implement the function using TDD.
The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and the subsequent numbers are the sum of the previous two.
Test Cases:
generateFibonacci(5) ➡️ Expected Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]
generateFibonacci(8) ➡️ Expected Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]
generateFibonacci(1) ➡️ Expected Output: [0]
